# Autonomous Campus Delivery Robot

## Simple Overview of the Project

This document presents the planning and implementation of an autonomous campus delivery robot aimed at addressing the logistical challenges created by the discontinuation of Sunway University's previous delivery system. The solution integrates SLAM technology with an efficient path planning approach and is developed on the ROS 1 platform, utilizing the pre-built HiWonder JetAuto hardware.

This project demonstrates the use of ROS-based SLAM on the JetAuto robot using the GMapping algorithm for autonomous mapping, while implementing TEB and Dijkstra algorithms for intelligent path planning. It supports autonomous navigation, real-time visualization in RViz, and persistent map storage for reliable campus delivery operations.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the initial setup and preparation for running the autonomous campus delivery robot.

### Hardware Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **HiWonder JetAuto Kit** or a robot with the following components:
  - LiDAR sensor
  - Motors
  - Computing unit (Jetson Nano or equivalent)
---

## Dependencies

- **ROS 1** (Robot Operating System) - Tested on ROS Noetic
- **Linux-based operating system** - Ubuntu 18.04 or later
- **Properly configured catkin workspace** for ROS development
- **Required Libraries:**

---

## Installing

### Build the workspace

```bash
catkin_make
```

### Set up the ROS environment

```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:[your_own_localhost]
```

### Verify installation

```bash
rospack find gmapping
rostopic list
```

---

## Executing Program

### Step 1: Stop Default Application Service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop start_app_node.service
```

### Step 2: Launch SLAM (GMapping)

Open two terminals.

**Terminal 1 - Start SLAM Node:**

```bash
roslaunch jetauto_slam slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping
```

**Terminal 2 - Start RViz Visualization:**

```bash
roslaunch jetauto_slam rviz_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping
```

### Step 3: Autonomous Campus Mapping

```bash
roslaunch jetauto_launch slam_exploration.launch
```

The robot will autonomously map the campus. Monitor progress in RViz.

### Step 4: Save the Campus Map

**Using service call:**

```bash
rosservice call /map_save
```

**Or manually:**

```bash
roscd jetauto_slam/maps
rosrun map_server map_saver -f campus_map map:=/jetauto_1/map
```

### Step 5: Launch Autonomous Delivery Navigation

```bash
# Terminal 1: Localization with saved map
roslaunch jetauto_slam slam_localization.launch map_file:=campus_map.yaml

# Terminal 2: Navigation stack
roslaunch jetauto_navigation move_base.launch
```

## Help

### Issue: ROS Master Already Running

If ROS Master is stuck on port 11311:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :11311
sudo kill -9 <PID>
sudo lsof -i :11311
```

Then relaunch:

```bash
roslaunch jetauto_slam slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping
```

### Issue: No Laser Scans Received

Check if LiDAR is connected:

```bash
lsusb | grep LIDAR
rostopic hz /scan
```

If permission issues:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo reboot
```

### Issue: Poor Map Quality

- Slow down exploration speed in configuration
- Clean sensor lens and check mounting
- Ensure adequate LiDAR visibility
- Check particle count in gmapping parameters
