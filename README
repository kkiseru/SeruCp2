# Autonomous Campus Delivery Robot

## Simple Overview of the Project

This document presents the planning and implementation of an autonomous campus delivery robot aimed at addressing the logistical challenges created by the discontinuation of Sunway University's previous delivery system. The solution integrates SLAM technology with an efficient path planning approach and is developed on the ROS 1 platform, utilizing the pre-built HiWonder JetAuto hardware.

This project demonstrates the use of ROS-based SLAM on the JetAuto robot using the GMapping algorithm for autonomous mapping, while implementing TEB and Dijkstra algorithms for intelligent path planning. It supports autonomous navigation, real-time visualization in RViz, and persistent map storage for reliable campus delivery operations.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the initial setup and preparation for running the autonomous campus delivery robot.

### Hardware Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **HiWonder JetAuto Kit** or a robot with the following components:
  - LiDAR sensor
  - Motors
  - Computing unit (Jetson Nano or equivalent)
---
## Dependencies

- **ROS 1** (Robot Operating System) - Tested on ROS Noetic
- **Linux-based operating system** - Ubuntu 18.04 or later
- **Properly configured catkin workspace** for ROS development

---

## Installing

### Clone the Repository

Fork the code into your directory:

```bash
cd ~/your_workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-campus-delivery-robot.git
cd autonomous-campus-delivery-robot
```

### Build the Workspace

```bash
cd ~/your_workspace
catkin_make
```

### Set up the ROS Environment
1. `catkin_make` in this folder

2. Export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:<Your Local Host>

3. Source the setup file:
```bash
source ~/your_workspace/devel/setup.sh
```

### Kill ROS Master (Important)

Before running any SLAM or navigation commands, always ensure ROS Master is not already running. Kill any existing ROS processes:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :<Your Local Host>
sudo kill -9 <PID>
sudo lsof -i :<Your Local Host>
```

Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID shown. The last command should return empty, indicating ROS Master is stopped.

### Verify Installation

```bash
rospack find gmapping
rostopic list
```

---

## Executing Program

All functionality is controlled through the `launch.sh` script. Run the script to see all available options:

```bash
./launch.sh
```

### Available Commands

**1. gmap** - Launch SLAM (GMapping)
```bash
./launch.sh gmap
```
Starts the GMapping SLAM algorithm and RViz visualization. The robot begins scanning and building a map of the environment.

**2. save** - Save the Campus Map
```bash
./launch.sh save
```
Saves the currently built map to persistent storage (`.pgm` image file and `.yaml` configuration file).

**3. gnavi** - SLAM with Navigation
```bash
./launch.sh gnavi
```
Launches both GMapping SLAM and the navigation stack together. Enables autonomous navigation with the built map.

**4. delivery** - Delivery Phase
```bash
./launch.sh delivery
```
Launches the autonomous delivery navigation system using a pre-built campus map. The robot uses saved map for localization and path planning.

**5. full** - Complete Workflow
```bash
./launch.sh full
```
Runs the complete workflow automatically: launches GMapping SLAM and navigation, waits 20 seconds for initialization, then automatically transitions to delivery phase. Use this for end-to-end testing.

## Help

### Issue: ROS Master Already Running

If ROS Master is stuck on port <Your Local Host>:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :<Your Local Host>
sudo kill -9 <PID>
sudo lsof -i :<Your Local Host>
```

Then relaunch:

```bash
roslaunch jetauto_slam slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping
```

### Issue: No Laser Scans Received

Check if LiDAR is connected:

```bash
lsusb | grep LIDAR
rostopic hz /scan
```

If permission issues:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo reboot
```
